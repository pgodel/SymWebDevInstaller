Symfony Web Developent Environment installer!

Usage:

symfony generate:project myproject --installer=path/to/SymWebDevInstaller.php

or

symfony generate:project myproject --installer=http://github.com/pgodel/SymWebDevInstaller/blob/master/SymWebDevInstaller.php


This installer will perform the following steps:
- setup hosts file
- Add virtual host configuration to Apache web server
- Restart Apache

Keep in mind that you need to have permissions to modify the respective files and restart Apache.

You will be prompted to enter the IP address, hostname, and asked to confirm each operation. You can skip each step as desired.

Please feel free to send me any bugs, patches or suggestions.
